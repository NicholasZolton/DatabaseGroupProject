# First Steps to Run

The very first thing you need to do if you want to run this frontend is do `npm install` in
the base frontend directory.

This will install svelte and all the necessary dependencies so that you can successfully run
the development server and build scripts.

Next, all you need to do is either run `npm run dev` to start the development server or
`npm run build` to build the frontend for production.

If you want to run the development server, you can access it at the address mentioned in
your console (after running `npm run dev`) in your web browser by default.

If you want to build the frontend for production, you can find the built files in the
`build` directory.

# Updating Frontend

Once you have done npm install and `npm run dev`, you can simply update the .svelte files and the 
changes will automatically appear on your development server without you even having to refresh
the page.

All you will need to do to see these changes in real-time is open the web development server in your
web browser.
